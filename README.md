# Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## Objective
To capture and analyze live network traffic in order to understand basic network communication and protocol behavior.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Windows OS
- Wi-Fi Network

## Methodology
- Selected the active Wi-Fi interface for packet capture
- Captured live network traffic while browsing standard websites
- Applied display filters to analyze specific protocols:
  - DNS
  - TCP
  - HTTP

## Observations
- DNS queries and responses were observed for domain name resolution
- TCP packets demonstrated reliable, connection-oriented communication
- HTTP traffic was minimal due to the widespread use of HTTPS encryption

## Outcome
This project improved understanding of packet-level network traffic and protocol analysis.

## Screenshots
Screenshots of DNS, TCP, and HTTP traffic analysis are included in the repository.

## Learning
Gained hands-on experience with Wireshark and strengthened fundamentals of network security analysis.
